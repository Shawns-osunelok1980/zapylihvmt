Okay, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Death of a Unicorn and OMG, like, what even was that  ??? Seriously, it was like someone took an art 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 and mashed it with a fever dream. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, no joke. The plot was all over the place, like they just tossed in unicorns for the sake of it. And the unicorn doesn't even show up until halfway through? I mean, come on! 😆

But you know what, it’s kind of got this weird charm? Like, you’re just sitting there, kinda entranced but also like wait, what am I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨? The acting was like, all over the map too. Some were pulling Oscar-worthy faces and others might as well have been cardboard cutouts. Who even writes this stuff???

>Oh, and don't even get me started on that soundtrack. It’s like they just pressed shuffle on a playlist of soundscapes and said “yep, that’ll do.” I was gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   so I could re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, see if it made more sense the second time around, but now I’m not so sure. Would my brain even survive that twice? 😜

Remember that scene with the mirror? What was that even supposed to symbolize? I feel like I should have understood some deep metaphor, but nah, just left more confused and a bit amused. And whose idea was it to end with that monologue about clouds and time and... cheese or something? It's like they ran out of ideas but had to fill those last ten minutes, lol. Classic move.

Anyway, in the middle of thinking all this randomness, I remembered that someone actually suggested I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and now I’m questioning their taste—and my sanity a lil bit too. Have you seen it? If not, maybe save it for a day when you're feeling existential. 😂

    print(what is happening)

Either way, it definitely wasn’t boring. Like, props for making me feel something, right? Anyway, let me know what you've been 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. Is there hope for the cinema, or are we still stuck in this land of unicorns and chaos? Catch you later!
